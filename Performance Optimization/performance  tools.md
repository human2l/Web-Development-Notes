Here are some extra resources and guides if you want a little more practice:

**Dev Tools:** 

1. [View main thread activities in a table](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/evaluate-performance/reference#activities) to sort activities based on which ones took up the most time.
2. [Analyze frames per second (FPS)](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/evaluate-performance/reference#fps) to measure whether your animations truly run smoothly.
3. [Monitor CPU usage, JS heap size, DOM nodes, layouts per second, and more](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/11/devtools-release-notes#perf-monitor) in real-time with the Performance Monitor.
4. [Capture screenshots while recording](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/evaluate-performance/reference#screenshots) to play back exactly how the page looked while the page loaded, or an animation fired, and so on.
5. [View interactions](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/evaluate-performance/reference#interactions) to quickly identify what happened on a page after a user interacted with it.
6. [Find scroll performance issues in real-time](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/evaluate-performance/reference#scrolling-performance-issues) by highlighting the page whenever a potentially problematic listener fires.
7. [View paint events in real-time](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/evaluate-performance/reference#paint-flashing) to identify costly paint events that may be harming the performance of your animations.
8. [View main thread activity](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/evaluate-performance/reference#main) to view every event that occurred on the main thread while you were recording.
