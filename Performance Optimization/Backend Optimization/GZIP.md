# GZIP

To use GZIP:

<img src="GZIP.assets/Screen Shot 2021-09-30 at 8.38.15 PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2021-09-30 at 8.38.15 PM" style="zoom:50%;" />

then all files send to the client are using GZIP

To test this out:

<img src="GZIP.assets/Screen Shot 2021-09-30 at 8.40.04 PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2021-09-30 at 8.40.04 PM" style="zoom:50%;" />

`content-encoding` will be gzip

## Files should be GZIPed:

<img src="GZIP.assets/Screen Shot 2021-09-30 at 8.44.25 PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2021-09-30 at 8.44.25 PM" style="zoom:50%;" />

<img src="GZIP.assets/Screen Shot 2021-09-30 at 8.43.18 PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2021-09-30 at 8.43.18 PM" style="zoom:50%;" />
