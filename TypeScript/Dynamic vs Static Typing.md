## Static Typing

### Pros:

self documentation, helpful auto completion, less bugs

### Cons:

extra layer of complexity, good unit tests can also reduce the same bugs, slower development process

# Strong vs Weak Typing

Javascript is dynamic and weak typed language.

In Javascript:

### Weak Typing

```js
type a = "booooyaa"
a + 17 //"booooyaa17"
//also called type coercion
```

### Strong Typing

```python
var = "booooyaa"
var + 17 ##Throw an error
```
