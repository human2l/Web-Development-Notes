### NPM v6

If you have NPM version 6 or higher, npm has finally added security as a built-in feature when downloading packages (yey!). You will get notified of security vulnerabilities in the packages you install now. For more information, please read this: https://medium.com/npm-inc/announcing-npm-6-5d0b1799a905 In regards to the *nsp* tool, please have a read here for the update: https://blog.npmjs.org/post/175511531085/the-node-security-platform-service-is-shutting. Now you can just simply use `npm audit fix` command. You actually saw me use the command in the **CWD: Keeping Your Projects Up To Date** lecture already so you can review that one more time if you would like to see it in action!
